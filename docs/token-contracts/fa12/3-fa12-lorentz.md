title: Create an Instance of an FA1.2 Contract on the Tezos Blockchain
sidebar_label: FA1.2 Lorentz

## Introduction to lorentz-contract-param


[lorentz-contract-metadata](https://github.com/tqtezos/lorentz-contract-metadata) - is
a version of FA1.2 with FA2-style metadata.

More information regarding FA2-style metadata may be found in
[TZIP-12](https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip/-/blob/master/proposals/tzip-12/tzip-12.md#token_metadata).

Install `lorentz-contract-metadata` tools by following
[installation instructions in `lorentz-contract-metadata` source code
repository](
https://github.com/tqtezos/lorentz-contract-metadata/blob/master/README.md)


## Originate

The `FA1.2` contract must be initialized with several storage parameters:

```haskell
Pair
  {}                   -- Empty ledger big_map
  (Pair
      "$ALICE_ADDRESS" -- Administrator address
      (Pair
          False        -- Is all activity currently paused? (no)
          0            -- Total supply of tokens
      )
  )
```

As well as inlined metadata parameters:

- `symbol`: `string`
- `name`: `string`
- `decimals`: `nat`, the number of digits to use after the decimal point when displaying token amounts.
- `extras`: `map string string`, all other metadata parameters

Note: FA2-style metadata also includes the `nat` value: `token_id`,
which is defined to be `0` for single-token contracts, such as FA1.2.

For this example, we'll use:

- `symbol`: `TOK`
- `name`: `Token`
- `decimals`: `0`
- `extras`: `{}`



Instead of providing contract parameters in raw Michelson, we can use
`lorentz-contract-metadata` to generate them.

To originate the contract, run:

```shell
$ tezos-client --wait none originate contract ManagedLedger \
  transferring 0 from $ALICE_ADDRESS running \
  "$(lorentz-contract-metadata Metadata print \
  --token-symbol "TOK" \
  --token-name "Token" \
  --token-decimals 0 \
  --oneline)" \
  --init "$(lorentz-contract-metadata Metadata init \
  --admin $ALICE_ADDRESS \
  --initial-ledger '[]')" --burn-cap 5.033 --force

## Views

When a contract parameter has a non-unit return type, e.g. `Get Total
Supply`, which returns the total supply of tokens, the contract needs
to be able to store the result somewhere. In particular, another
contract accepting the return value.

For the following examples, we need contracts accepting `address`,
`nat`, and `token_metadata` values:


### For nat

```shell
$ tezos-client --wait none originate contract nat_storage transferring 0 \
  from $ALICE_ADDRESS running "{ parameter nat ; storage nat ; code { CAR ; NIL operation ; PAIR } }" \
  --init 0 --burn-cap 0.295

Note: you may have to set/increase the burn cap to allow the
contract(s) to be originated, e.g.:

```shell
$ tezos-client --wait none originate contract address_storage transferring 0 \
  from $ALICE_ADDRESS running "{ parameter address ; storage address ; code { CAR ; NIL operation ; PAIR } }" \
  --init "\"$ALICE_ADDRESS\"" --burn-cap 0.0001 --dry-run

Node is bootstrapped, ready for injecting operations.
Fatal error:
  The operation will burn ꜩ0.32 which is higher than the configured burn cap (ꜩ0.0001).
   Use `--burn-cap 0.32` to emit this operation.
```


Then, using `tezos-client get receipt for [Operation hash]` for each
operation hash, store the contract addresses in variables:

```shell
NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS="KT1.."
ADDRESS_STORAGE_ADDRESS="KT1.."
METADATA_STORAGE_ADDRESS="KT1.."
```

Next, you may access the stored values with the following two commands
for `nat` and `address`, respectively:

```shell
$ tezos-client get contract storage for $NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS

0

$ tezos-client get contract storage for $ADDRESS_STORAGE_ADDRESS

"tz1bDCu64RmcpWahdn9bWrDMi6cu7mXZynHm"
```

## Interact using tezos-client

Commands to interact with our ManagedLedger contract instance using
`tezos-client` and `lorentz-contract-param` all follow the same
pattern with only a few parameters changing depending on which
contract entry point we invoke. Using `getTotalSupply` as an example,
invocation looks like this:

```shell
$ tezos-client --wait none transfer 0 from $ALICE_ADDRESS to $FA12_ADDRESS \
  --arg "$(lorentz-contract-metadata \
  Metadata getTotalSupply \
  --callback-contract $NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS)"
```

Let's capture the pattern in a shell function:

```shell
$ fa12(){tezos-client --wait none transfer 0 from $ALICE_ADDRESS to $FA12_ADDRESS --burn-cap 0.5 --arg "$(lorentz-contract-metadata Metadata $@;)"}
```

Note that we also set `--burn-cap` here. [see `burn-cap`](#higherthantheconfiguredburncap).


### Get Total Supply

With `fa12` function defined we can now invoke contract's
`getTotalSupply` entrypoint like so:

```shell
$ fa12 getTotalSupply --callback-contract $NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS
```

The output of this command looks like this:

```shell

contract at `NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS` which we can see using the following
command (once tezos network includes our operations):

```shell
$ tezos-client get contract storage for $NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS

0
```

### Get Administrator

To get the current administrator's address, first put it into
`ADDRESS_STORAGE_ADDRESS` contract:

```shell
$ fa12 getAdministrator --callback-contract $ADDRESS_STORAGE_ADDRESS
```

As with `NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS`, we may access the result using `get
contract storage for` and ensure that it matches Alice's address using
`echo $ALICE_ADDRESS`:

```shell
$ tezos-client get contract storage for $ADDRESS_STORAGE_ADDRESS

"tz1bDCu64RmcpWahdn9bWrDMi6cu7mXZynHm"

$ echo $ALICE_ADDRESS

tz1bDCu64RmcpWahdn9bWrDMi6cu7mXZynHm
```


### Get Balance

To get the balance of tokens for a particular address (stored in the
`NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS` contract):

```shell
$ fa12 getBalance --owner $ALICE_ADDRESS --callback-contract $NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS
```

We can then access the result using:

```shell
$ tezos-client get contract storage for $NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS

0
```


### Get Metadata

To get the token metadata for a particular FA1.2 + FA2-style metadata contract
(stored in the `METADATA_STORAGE_ADDRESS`):

```shell
$ fa12 getMetadata --callback-contract $METADATA_STORAGE_ADDRESS
```

We can then access the result using:

```
$ tezos-client get contract storage for $METADATA_STORAGE_ADDRESS

{ Pair 0 (Pair "TOK" (Pair "Token" (Pair 0 {}))) }
```




### Get Allowance

To get Bob's allowance to withdraw from Alice's account, where Bob's
address is `BOB_ADDRESS`:

```shell
$ fa12 getAllowance --owner $ALICE_ADDRESS --spender $BOB_ADDRESS --callback-contract $NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS

```

We can then access the result using:

```
$ tezos-client get contract storage for $NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS

0
```


### Transfer

From `GetBalance` above, we know that `Alice` doesn't have any tokens.

To transfer tokens from Alice to Bob, we first need to give Alice some
tokens.  We can do that by minting `5` tokens and allocating them to
Alice (See the `Mint` subsection below):

```
$ fa12 mint --value 5 --to $ALICE_ADDRESS
```

To transfer `2` tokens from Alice to Bob:

```
$ fa12 transfer --value 2 --from $ALICE_ADDRESS --to $BOB_ADDRESS
```

Check Bob's balance:

```
$ fa12 getBalance --owner $BOB_ADDRESS --callback-contract $NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS
$ tezos-client get contract storage for $NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS
2
```

### Approve

For Alice to approve Bob to withdraw up to `2` tokens from her
address:

```
$ fa12 approve --value 2 --spender $BOB_ADDRESS
```

We can then check the resulting allowance using:

```
$ fa12 getAllowance --owner $ALICE_ADDRESS --spender $BOB_ADDRESS --callback-contract $NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS
```

```
$ tezos-client get contract storage for $NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS
2
```

If we try to set another allowance (`4`) for Bob to withdraw from Alice, we are
met with a failure:
```
$ fa12 approve --value 4 --spender $BOB_ADDRESS
...
At line 294 characters 85 to 93,
script reached FAILWITH instruction
with (Pair "UnsafeAllowanceChange" 2)
```

The FA1.2 contract prohibits direct changes of allowance from a non-`0` value to
another non-`0` value, in order to prevent the known [Approve attack vector](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM).

So, in order to make such an allowance change, we need to first set it to `0`:
```
$ fa12 approve --value 0 --spender $BOB_ADDRESS
```
and then to the new value, `4`:
```
$ fa12 approve --value 4 --spender $BOB_ADDRESS
```
that now won't result in a failure.

Note however that, in general, this is not entirely safe, because Bob could have
spent some of his allowance from Alice, in the time between the transaction where
we first set it to `2` and the one where it was set to `0`.

In order to properly calculate the new non-`0` value, we'd need to scan all the
transactions happened between those two, but here we'll assume for simplicity
that there have been none.

We can now check the allowance again and see that it has changed:

```
$ fa12 getAllowance --owner $ALICE_ADDRESS --spender $BOB_ADDRESS --callback-contract $NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS
$ tezos-client get contract storage for $NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS
4
```

### Mint

To mint `5` tokens and allocate them to Alice:

```
$ fa12 mint --value 5 --to $ALICE_ADDRESS
$ fa12 getBalance --owner $ALICE_ADDRESS --callback-contract $NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS
$ tezos-client get contract storage for $NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS
5
```

### Burn

If you've been following this guide step-by-step, Bob's account should
have `3` tokens at this point. If it doesn't, add at least `1` using
`Transfer` or `Mint`.

Before burning, we first add `2` tokens to Bob's address:

```
$ fa12 mint --value 2 --to $BOB_ADDRESS
```

We can ensure Bob has at least `3` tokens using:

```
$ fa12 getBalance --owner $BOB_ADDRESS --callback-contract $NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS
$ tezos-client get contract storage for $NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS
5
```

Finally, we can burn `2` of Bob's tokens using:

```
$ fa12 burn --value 2 --from $BOB_ADDRESS
```

And then we may confirm that two tokens have been subtracted from
Bob's account:

```
$ fa12 getBalance --owner $BOB_ADDRESS --callback-contract $NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS
$ tezos-client get contract storage for $NAT_STORAGE_ADDRESS
3
```

### Pause Contract

To pause the contract:

```
$ fa12 setPause --paused True
```

We can check whether the contract is paused using:

```
$ tezos-client get contract storage for $FA12_ADDRESS
Pair 0 (Pair "tz1bDCu64RmcpWahdn9bWrDMi6cu7mXZynHm" (Pair True 7))
```

`True` value indicates that it's paused, a `False` value
indicicates that it's _not_ paused.

Transfers and approvals are are disabled while contract is paused. Try:

```
$ fa12 transfer --value 1 --from $ALICE_ADDRESS --to $BOB_ADDRESS
```

The command produces output like this (omitting included contract's
Michelson code for brevity):

```

```


To unpause the contract:

```
$ fa12 setPause --paused False
```

```
$ tezos-client get contract storage for $FA12_ADDRESS

Pair 0 (Pair "tz1bDCu64RmcpWahdn9bWrDMi6cu7mXZynHm" (Pair False 7))

```

### Set New Administrator

To make Bob the new administrator:

```
$ fa12 setAdministrator --new-administrator-address $BOB_ADDRESS
```

We can ensure that the administrator has been updated using:

```
$ fa12 getAdministrator --callback-contract $ADDRESS_STORAGE_ADDRESS
$ tezos-client get contract storage for $ADDRESS_STORAGE_ADDRESS
"tz1RwoEdg4efDQHarsw6aKtMUYvg278Gv1ir"
```

```
$ echo $BOB_ADDRESS

tz1RwoEdg4efDQHarsw6aKtMUYvg278Gv1ir
```

Our `fa12` shell function is set up to invoke operations using
`$ALICE_ADDRESS`, so now that `$ALICE_ADDRESS` is no longer the administrator
attempts to invoke admin entrypoints from that address will fail:

```
$ fa12 mint --value 5 --to $ALICE_ADDRESS
...
  586:                          PAIR } } } } } }
At line 447 characters 86 to 94,

```

## Interact using PyTezos

### Install PyTezos

If on Debian or Ubuntu Linux, install dependencies with `apt`:

```shell
sudo apt install libsodium-dev libsecp256k1-dev libgmp-dev
```

On Arch Linux, install these packages with `pacman`:

```shell
sudo pacman libsodium libsec256k1 gmp
```
You may also need to install python-wheel

Otherwise, if on Mac OS, install them with `brew`:

```shell
brew tap cuber/homebrew-libsecp256k1
brew install libsodium libsecp256k1 gmp
```

Next, install PyTezos with `pip3`:

```
pip3 install pytezos
```

### Originate the contract

Assuming that `$ALICE_ADDRESS` is defined, we can originate a copy of
`FA1.2` in much the same way as with `lorentz-contracts`.

Note: See the [Client Setup Guide](/docs/setup/1-tezos-client) to make a
wallet and define `$ALICE_ADDRESS`.

We begin by opening `python3`, setting the `key` and `shell`, and
specifying `fa12` as a contract:

Note: replace `~/Downloads/tz1R3vJ5TV8Y5pVj8dicBR23Zv8JArusDkYr.json`
with the path to your wallet `.json` file.

```py
$ python3
Python 3.7.4 (default, Sep  7 2019, 18:27:02)
[Clang 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.4)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from pytezos import pytezos
>>> pytezos = pytezos.using(key='~/Downloads/tz1R3vJ5TV8Y5pVj8dicBR23Zv8JArusDkYr.json', shell='babylonnet')

>>> alice_address = 'tz1R3vJ5TV8Y5pVj8dicBR23Zv8JArusDkYr'
>>> bob_address = 'tz1bDCu64RmcpWahdn9bWrDMi6cu7mXZynHm'
>>> nat_storage_address = 'KT1J4mhVAaMYAPC4aPEkhC9i48PHBHxavkJ2'
```

Next, we define a `Contract` from [a copy of
`ManagedLedger.tz`](https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip/blob/16ca4fbb60f2ab52958136b76a1d12b342beba58/Proposals/TZIP-0007/ManagedLedger.tz)
with annotations:

```py
>>> from pytezos import Contract
>>> import requests

>>> contract_url = 'https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip/raw/16ca4fbb60f2ab52958136b76a1d12b342beba58/Proposals/TZIP-0007/ManagedLedger.tz'
>>> fa12src = Contract.from_michelson(requests.get(contract_url).text)
```

We need to create the initial storage to originate the contract.

To help with this, we can view the contract's storage schema:

```py
>>> fa12src.storage
<pytezos.michelson.contract.ContractStorage object at 0x10d984590>

$storage:
    {
      "ledger": { $address : $ledger_item , ... }  /* big_map */,
      "admin": $address,
      "paused": bool,
      "totalSupply": $nat
    }

$ledger_item:
    {
      "balance": $nat,
      "approvals": { $address : $nat , ... }
    }

$nat:
    int  /* Natural number */

$address:
    string  /* Base58 encoded `tz` or `KT` address */


Helpers
.big_map_decode()
.big_map_diff_decode()
.big_map_diff_encode()
.big_map_id()
.big_map_init()
.big_map_query()
.decode()
.default()
.encode()
```

Next, we choose initial storage values and encode it to prepare for
contract origination:

```py
>>> init_storage = fa12src.storage.encode({
    ...:  "ledger": {},
    ...:  "admin": pytezos.key.public_key_hash(),
    ...:  "paused": False,
    ...:  "totalSupply": 0
    ...: } )
```

Next, we originate the contract:

```py
>>> origination_op = pytezos.origination(script=dict(code=fa12src.code, storage=init_storage)).autofill().sign().inject()
>>> origination_hash = origination_op['hash']
>>> origination_hash
'opXxLwE3j9ZY9Rv99Pomh6u7SonKAoywzpU6KkdWtFryUhBbXdP'
```


However, the origination does not return the resulting contract's
address, so we need to find the _completed_ operation in the network
and derive the contract's address from it:

```py
>>> opg = pytezos.shell.blocks[-5:].find_operation(origination_hash)
>>> contract_id = opg['contents'][0]['metadata']['operation_result']['originated_contracts'][0]
>>> contract_id
'KT1GV7wkUgZpEznQ48VR1UUSgXAU5Lk1SfpH'

>>> fa12 = pytezos.contract(contract_id)
```

Note: the `find_operation` command can fail if the operation has not
yet been processed:

```py
>>> opg = pytezos.shell.blocks[-5:].find_operation(origination_op)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytezos/tools/docstring.py", line 67, in __call__

    raise StopIteration(operation_group_hash)
StopIteration: oonhxpbH9Jc7fpbjfzvfbetppEBnjUTFmkbziVFV3B5KhjVdzpd
```

### Inspect the Schema

We can view the parameter schema to find out which entry points the
contract supports and what their arguments are:

```py
>>> fa12.contract.parameter
<pytezos.michelson.contract.ContractParameter object at 0x10ce5d910>

$parameter:
    { "transfer": $transfer } ||
    { "approve": $approve } ||
    { "getAllowance": [ $address , $address , $contract (nat) ] } ||
    { "getBalance": [ $address , $contract (nat) ] } ||
    { "getTotalSupply": [ $unit , $contract (nat) ] } ||
    { "setPause": bool  /* setPause */ } ||
    { "setAdministrator": $address  /* setAdministrator */ } ||
    { "getAdministrator": [ $unit , $contract (address) ] } ||
    { "mint": $mint } ||
    { "burn": $burn }

$burn:
    {
      "from": $address,
      "value": $nat
    }

$mint:
    {
      "to": $address,
      "value": $nat
    }

$approve:
    {
      "spender": $address,
      "value": $nat
    }

$transfer:
    {
      "from": $address,
      "to": $address,
      "value": $nat
    }

$contract:
    string  /* Base58 encoded `KT` address */

$nat:
    int  /* Natural number */

$address:
    string  /* Base58 encoded `tz` or `KT` address */

$unit:
    None /* Void */


Helpers
.decode()
.encode()
.entries()
```

### Interacting with FA1.2

Finally, using the parameter schema, we can perform a transfer using
the following steps:

- Mint `5` tokens to `alice_address`
- Transfer `3` tokens from `alice_address` to `bob_address`
- Store `bob_address`'s balance in `nat_storage_address`
- Get the storage value of `nat_storage_address`

```py
>>> op = fa12.mint(to=alice_address, value=5).inject()
>>> op['hash']
'opDS6FUYmzXBRpX1DxpnucWBrcyEvCmAsSdjmHJMNpf7xQhGsRW'

>>> op = fa12.transfer(**{'from': alice_address, 'to': bob_address, 'value': 3}).inject()
>>> op['hash']
'ooQRsxqkV3vEtaDdarMzvzFuZLeKe6qfJkZEx9PntzqHGxVo8FU'

>>> op = fa12.getBalance(bob_address, nat_storage_address).inject()
>>> op['hash']
'opUVaphfSFgeUTACVmspr6bXrY82RLJ4mSf4DgT2kNZ6SiEcuh6'

>>> pytezos.contract(nat_storage_address).storage()
3
```

Note: Why `.transfer(**{'from': ..})` instead of `.transfer(from=..)`?
In Python, `from` is a keyword and may not be used to specify an
argument so we use `**{..}` to convert a dictionary into keyword
arguments.

## Troubleshooting

### Counter _ already used

This error occurs when a dependent operation has not yet been included
and can take one of the following forms:

```
$ tezos-client --wait none transfer 0 from $ALICE_ADDRESS to $FA12_ADDRESS --arg ..

Waiting for the node to be bootstrapped before injection...
Current head: BMe8VmYBa1Ye (timestamp: 2019-08-12T15:34:56-00:00, validation: 2019-08-12T15:35:00-00:00)

```

To fix, either:
- Wait for the operation to be included
- Run `tezos-client wait for [Operation Hash] to be included` with the
  dependent operation's `Operation Hash` before continuing
  * Alternatively, you may run: `tz get receipt for
    [Operation Hash]`


### Higher than the configured burn cap

This error may occur when `--burn-cap` is not specified or it's set
too low for the current operation:

```
$ tezos-client --wait none transfer 0 from $ALICE_ADDRESS to $FA12_ADDRESS --arg ..

Waiting for the node to be bootstrapped before injection...
Current head: BLBsvLowXAPf (timestamp: 2019-08-12T15:41:56-00:00, validation: 2019-08-12T15:42:45-00:00)

Fatal error:
  The operation will burn ꜩ0.021 which is higher than the configured burn cap (ꜩ0).
   Use `--burn-cap 0.021` to emit this operation.
```

To fix, replace or add `--burn-cap` with the given recommendation (in
this case, `--burn-cap 0.021`)
